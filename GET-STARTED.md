### **IF YOU WANT TO SAVE TO USB:**
1. Find `index.html` in your Files app
2. Copy to USB drive
3. You can use it on any computer!

---

### **IF YOU WANT IT ONLINE 24/7:**
1. Push code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial upload"
   git push
   ```
2. Go to https://render.com
3. Follow the "Deploy to Render" section in README.md

---

### **IF YOU WANT GITHUB PAGES (Free Link):**
1. Push code first (see above)
2. Go to GitHub Settings → Pages
3. Select `main` branch
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. You get: `https://your-username.github.io/ultimate-unblocker-proxy/`

## 📊 Quick Comparison

| Need | Solution | Time |
|------|----------|------|
| Test locally | `npm start` | 10 sec |
| Use on USB | Copy `index.html` to USB | 30 sec |
| Share a link | GitHub Pages | 3 min |
| Always online | Render.com | 5 min |
| Full control | Run `server.js` | 1 min |

## 🎯 What Each File Does

### `server.js`
- Listens on port 3000
- Fetches websites you request
- Removes security headers
- Rewrites URLs so links work
- Returns everything to your browser

### `public/index.html`
- The user interface
- Text box to enter URLs
- The green button to click
- Shows results in an iframe

### `index.html`
- Single-file version
- Works on GitHub Pages
- Works on USB
- Uses public proxy API

### `package.json`
- Lists what Node packages you need
- Tells npm what to install

---

## 💡 How It Works (Simple)

```
You:  "I want to visit example.com"
      ↓
Browser: "Server, fetch example.com for me"
         ↓
Server (server.js): "OK, I'll get it"
                    ↓
                    Fetches example.com
                    Removes blocking headers
                    Rewrites links to go through me
                    ↓
Browser: "Here's the result!"
         ↓
You: "It works! 🎉"
```

## ⚙️ The 3 Versions Explained

### Version 1: Full Node.js (Most Powerful)
```
Pros:
✅ Fast
✅ Works with almost any site
✅ Full control
✅ Best for production

Cons:
❌ Needs a server running
❌ Can't use on USB
```

### Version 2: Single HTML (Most Portable)
```
Pros:
✅ Works on USB
✅ No setup needed
✅ Works everywhere
✅ Share just one file

Cons:
❌ Slower
❌ Some sites won't work
❌ Limited functionality
```

### Version 3: Render.com (Most Reliable)
```
Pros:
✅ Always online
✅ Share with anyone
✅ Free
✅ Automatic updates

Cons:
❌ Takes 5 minutes to set up
❌ Free tier "sleeps" after 15 min
```

## 🔒 Important Reminders

⚠️ **Legal Use Only**
- Educational purposes
- With permission from your school/work
- Following all laws

❌ **Don't Use For:**
- Accessing paid content illegally
- Bypassing security you're not authorized for
- Violating terms of service

---

## 📱 Chromebook Specific

### You Can:
✅ Use GitHub Codespaces (you're here now!)
✅ Save HTML file to USB
✅ Deploy to Render.com
✅ Use GitHub Pages

### You Can't (without special setup):
❌ Run Node.js directly on Chromebook
❌ Keep server running after logout

---

## 🆘 If Something Breaks

1. **"Cannot GET /proxy"**
   - Make sure `npm start` is running
   - Check the terminal for errors

2. **"Site won't load"**
   - Try a simpler site first (example.com)
   - The site may be blocking proxies

3. **"Can't find module"**
   - Run `npm install`

4. **"Permission denied"**
   - Make sure you're in the right folder
   - Ask for help if you're stuck!
